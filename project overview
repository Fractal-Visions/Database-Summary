Fractal Visions is an OP centric creator platform for retroactive and quadratic funding on Optimism or Base.

Public goods initiatives from across the planet need more visibility for the intention behind their cause for impact.
Audio, Visual, A.i., ReFi, and DeSci projects often have a hard time finding their path in the blockchain space which is why we are here.
With the help of Gitcoin grants & the rewards we have received from Retro PGF round 2 and round 3, our core engineer team has contributed to the ecosystem by building the MVP.

The implementation of our own marketplace also intertwines the open source software technology of Allo protocol.
Fractal Visions hybrid grants platform for both Retroactive & Quadratic Funding established an independent grants program for Superchain contributors.
Fractal Visions impact initiative platform is utilizing the public goods ethos of Optimism with a retroactive rewards mechanism generated by the marketplace fee from sales to attract authentic creators or developers who are making a significant change with meaningful impact in the real world.
